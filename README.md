<h1>Pitch for Our Class Publication</h1>
<h2>What is the idea for a publication? </h2>
<div>An online publication geared toward millennials living in the greater New York City area. All too often, millennials are stereotyped as only getting news from Facebook, or even worse, not caring about news at all. But, as the enrollment at our school seems to show, this stereotype is nothing but an exaggeration.</div>
<h2>Who is your audience? </h2>
<div>Millennials (or Generation Y, or the cohort of births between the mid-80s to mid-90s) living in and around New York City</div>
<h2>Is there a similar publication? </h2>
<div>If yes, how will your publication differentiate itself from the existing publication? Possibly similar to how buzzed News operates, with headlines such as “What to Expect When You’re Expecting the Collapse of Society as You Know It,” or pieces on Mashable or Vice, yet this publication would be centered around greater New York City. In some ways, DNAinfo could be a close comparison, but the proposed publication would be more feature-type stories, and not just hard-news. </div>
<h2>Give a few general examples of pieces that might run on this site.</h2>
<div>A story of crime statistics per NYC neighborhood with comparable other city neighborhoods to show your grandma that it really is safe enough where you live. Where our trash and recycling goes in the five boroughs, compared to where it went in the past, and how much per neighborhood, etc. An explainer on city politics, how Community Boards work, etc.</div>
